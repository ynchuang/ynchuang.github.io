### About Me
---
Howdy! Iâ€™m Yu-Neng Chuang, a final-year Ph.D. candidate from the Department of [Computer Science at Rice University](https://cs.rice.edu/), co-advised by Dr. [Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) and Dr. [Vladimir Braverman](https://cs.rice.edu/~vb21/). Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, both from National ChengChi University.

My research interests include (1) Multi-modal Agentic LLMs, (2) Efficient LLM (Long Context & Efficient Reasoning), (3) LLM Routing and Uncertainty. Currently, I am focusing on efficient LLM reasoning, LLM Agent Memory, and LLM reasoning for agentic tool usage.

I was a research intern at Google Deepmind <img src="assets/img/deepmind.png" alt="Google DeepMind" style="height: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;"/>, was a research intern at Apple <img src="assets/img/apple.svg" alt="Apple" style="height: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;"/>, and was a research intern at Samsung Reserach America<img src="assets/img/samsung.jpeg" alt="Samsung Research America" style="height: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;"/>. I am currently working on industrial collaboration project with Meta AI <img src="assets/img/meta.png" alt="Meta AI" style="height: 15px; margin-bottom: 6px;"/>.
