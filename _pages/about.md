### About me

Howdy! I’m Yu-Neng Chuang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the Department of [Computer Science at Rice University](https://cs.rice.edu/), co-advised by Dr. [Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) and Prof. [Vladimir Braverman](https://cs.rice.edu/~vb21/). Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and my master’s degree in Computer Science, both from National ChengChi University. My research interests include Trustworthiness (Uncertainty, Explainability, and Safety) of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLMs Reasoning and Alignment, and Multi-Agent Planning.
